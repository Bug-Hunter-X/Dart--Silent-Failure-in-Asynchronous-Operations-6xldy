# Dart: Silent Failure in Asynchronous Operations

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: the failure to properly handle exceptions during asynchronous operations.  Improper handling can lead to unexpected behavior and silent failures in your applications, making debugging difficult.

The `bug.dart` file showcases the problematic code. The `bugSolution.dart` file shows how to fix it.

**Key Issues Addressed:**

* **Handling Non-200 HTTP Status Codes:** The original code lacks proper handling for HTTP status codes other than 200 (OK).  A network request could fail for various reasons, and simply ignoring these failures is risky.
* **Exception Handling:** Comprehensive exception handling in the `catch` block is crucial. Logging errors or rethrowing them allows for better debugging and higher application resilience.
* **Rethrowing Exceptions:** The `rethrow` keyword is shown in the solution to allow for more robust error handling at a higher level of the call stack.
